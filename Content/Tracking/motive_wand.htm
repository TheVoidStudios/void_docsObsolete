        <h1>TED&#160;2017 Blaster</h1>
        <p>For TED&#160;2017, The VOID brought the Ghostbusters experience. However, a small adjustment had to be made for TED. Guns were not permitted. A special blaster (wand) was created for TED.</p>
        <p>Defining the wand rigid body is similar to the gun rigid body with these exceptions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Name the wands as 'WAND 2##'; where # is the two-digit sequential number. For example, the first Wand is WAND&#160;201.</li>
            <li>When setting the pivot point, the temporary marker is placed at the top. <div class="image"><p>For example:</p><p><img src="../Resources/Images/Motive/TEDblaster.png" class="examples" title="click to enlarge" /></p></div></li>
        </ul>
    </body>
